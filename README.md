# Travel Journal - A solo project from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home)

This my solution to the project Travel Journal from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).
All the styles are followed by the figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=e2mKBsPSBX36ssyr-0)

### Skills required
- Retrieve data from another file
- Javascript: Use .map() array method & props
- CSS: flexbox & naming (for better readability) & selector

### My thought process
1. create all the components that are needed (In this case, only <Header /> and <Entry /> are needed)
2. set up <Header /> and style it accordingly
3. set up <Entry /> and style it with hard-coded data
4. Once the styles are good, pass all the data through props from data.js
